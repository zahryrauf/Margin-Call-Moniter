<p>Margin Call Monitor is a Laravel-based web application utilizing MongoDB as a NoSQL database. It empowers brokers to efficiently manage trader details, monitor stock positions, calculate equities, and receive real-time alerts for potential margin calls. The platform features role-based dashboards for admins (to oversee users) and brokers (to handle traders), with AJAX-driven updates for seamless interactions. This project showcases NoSQL's flexibility, scalability, and practical applications in financial data management, while highlighting its strengths like schema-less design and limitations such as eventual consistency.</p>
